# Discord-SlidingPuzzle
Sliding Puzzle rendered with Discord Emojis

Intended to be used on small amount of servers (less than 10), as it uses Create Guild discord endpoint to store puzzle emojis.
Create Guild endpoint works only on what Discord classifies as "small bots", so the current implementation of this feature isn't suitable to be used on a public bot.

It does support gifs but discord shows them out of sync often, which is kinda bad, so right now it just turns them into pngs.
